This repository contains a single control that is being used for entering valid phone numbers 
for any country in the world. The library has a dependency to [Google's _libphonenumber_ library](https://github.com/google/libphonenumber/),
which is rather big in size, hence we decided to distribute this control via its own project on 
GitHub (as opposed to adding it to the GemsFX project.)

The demo website of Google's library [can be found here](https://libphonenumber.appspot.com).

A great tutorial for this control [can be found here](https://coderscratchpad.com/javafx-phone-number-input-field/).
